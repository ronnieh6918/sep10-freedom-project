# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Ronnie Huang**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Security and Investigations**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-Frame** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The field of security and investigation applies to **government and laws** because detectives and investigators are essential in keeping track of criminal activities and background info checking, ensuring the following of the law to become certified investigators, gaining trust from the government and most importantly engaging in tasks that offer risks but gains by securing the safety of others and the use of technologies required for background research exclusively to those certified as valuing the law and understanding the importance of looking through privacy in certain cases and scenarios.
* The field of security and investigation applies to **jobs** because being a detective can also engage in a lot of criminology. In a lot of cases, security and investigation provide a lot of jobs, one of which are detectives who might be tasked in researching during crime scenes. On the otherhand, the field offers jobs as private investigators wjo can also be hired by companies to initate tasks relating to securing confidential informations from being stolen online. A lot of security and investigation is about jobs that values the priority of securing privacy and also doing tasks that are protecting others.
* For the **environment**, my future technologies significantly improve less likelyhood for paper, especially when investigators are tasked with investigating their suspects, they need to be prepared to record their actions. Hence, the digital notebook is perfect for keeping notes organized, the notebook also have functions that make it so your files with the information is secured. Less likely to lose the digital file records than writing on a regular notebook.
* For **finance**, private investigators who work for companies are actively securing the company from suspects online who might have evil intent and methods of trying to seek confidental information to exploit. A lot of times, private investigators are able to prevent data from being stolen and is able to successfully secure confidential informations which if not taken responsibly could have resulted damage in the company's economic state. 
##### CONS
* Regarding to **individuals**, unreliable detectives and investigators could essentially uncover much deeper privacy that relates to their suspects, even though privacy should be respected, a lot of privacy might be exposed and potentially put to danger and acknowledged by detectives and investigators to manipulate.
* Regarding to **culture**, unreliable detectives and investigators who expose one's privacy could really affect someone's cultural identity and how they want their identity to be secured from the general public. A lot of that someone's personal data may be easily exposed and shared to others which can pose dangers to respecting someone's culture, their livestyle, their norms and expectations, while also putting a risk in their privacy.
