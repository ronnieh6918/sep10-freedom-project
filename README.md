# SEP10 Freedom Project
by **Ronnie Huang**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **Security and Investigations**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-Frame** in order to help me make my website.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The field security and investigation applies to government and laws because investigators are responsible in keeping track of criminal activities, ensuring the protection of safety of others and following the laws despite being certified as a private investigator to provide security for their employeers
##### CONS
*
