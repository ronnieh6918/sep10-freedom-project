                        <p>Security and investigation have been very important in keeping important confidential information safe from prying eyes. In the field of Security and Investigation, there are many technologies that help private investigators research and face directly with targeted suspects.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 class="other-font">What informations did I research in the department of Security and Investigation?</h3>
                        <p>My research on this topic is about finding existing software apps that is available for all platforms to use and access. The point of finding these software apps is so that those who are private investigators can be manuevered with these apps in order to help effectively during their investigations. Not only have I researched about different software apps that private investigator can use, there are also existing hardware tools that can also help with their investigation when they need to rely more on confronting suspects rather than using software apps that don't help physically.  </p>

                <h3>Future ideas:</h3>
                <p>My first idea would be a notebook that never runs out, like a digital notebook, without internet access, while you can reshape it by turning it into a folder to store paper files.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The notebook should be physically small, so it’s essentially easy to carry and lightweight.</li>
                    <li>The good side to this is that people in the field of security and investigation are able to write on their notebooks rather than solely relying on software apps to record their own audio and write for them, in some cases there might be an internet outbreak and so it might be difficult to access software apps that require internet.</li>
                    <li>The notebook is portable and does not require wifi or internet connection.</li>
                    <li>By not requiring wifi, the notebook can be accessed through charging manually.</li>
                    <li>Save trees since technology has advanced and the amount of trees to make paper decreases.</li>
                    <li>The notebooks are easy to transfer data and information as long as you create an account via proof of identity.</li>
                    <li>The notebooks can be styled according to your liking, for example like a regular notebook using a cover which helps with avoiding detection from suspects.</li>
                    <li>The notebook can detect grammatical errors when you’re writing on it. If you hold a button on the side of the notebook, you can reshape the notebook into a folder!</li>
                    <li>Since the notebook might not be the right size, there is also a size preference option, the notebook can shrink using similar functions like turning down the brightness or sound.</li>

                <h3>Future ideas:</h3>
                <p>My second idea would be to advocate for gadgets, since we have to carry gadgets via bags, what if we were to make translucent bags by using another type of equipment? </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Connect with a watch that simply creates a holographic bag whenever you need it! </li>
                    <li>Is it translucent, well not entirely, but about translucent enough for suspects to not notice at a balanced fair distance. </li>
                    <li>Is it infinite? Well no, since you can make ONE holographic bag disappear and reappear as long as you’re in distance and have access to the watch.</li>
                    <li>The watch can detect the holographic bag if stolen, this makes it efficient enough if gadgets are being stolen from someone.</li>
                    <li>The bag can BE HUGE Or small, depending on how large you customize the bag using the watch functions of adjustment.</li>
