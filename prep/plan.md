| Rain Song | I like how you have a section where all the cards exist with content and the carousel functions well; images are same scale  | Consider making the cards the same height and at certain screen sizes, the text overlaps with the images.
| Cammi Wong | I like the cards that you displayed for your software and hardware by using bootstraps grid system!
I suggest putting a fixed navbar on the top of your website, so that users do not have to keep scrolling up if they want to locate a specific section.
| Gabriel Mora | Everything is very smooth and is nice to look at. The title on the carousel is kinda hard to read and I think you should seperate the title and the liinks in the navbar.
| Winnie Chen | Glow: I like how the header has this cool background carousel image of your topic. It looks really cool! I also like the layout of your website. Grow: Something you should consider is adding a fixed navbar also, you can try making your card all the same size for the hardware section.
| Jolee Liu  | Glow: I liked how you chose to present your information about hardware and software on cards as well as the visual representations of both current and future technology regarding security. Grow: have you considered making your navbar fixed to the top of the screen ?
| Darren Li  | Glow: Your cards and navbar work properly and your website has good responsive components. Grow: On small screens (about 600 px) your images for future technologies are partially going off screen, and your "security and investigation" header starts to go over other text. This can be fixed by using media queries to adjust the position or size of elements at certain screen sizes. On medium sized screens the "what is security and investigation?" and "What informations did I research in the department of Security and Investigation?" sections get smaller, wasting space. To fix this you should change the col-md that affects it into a col-lg. On large screens the images for your future technologies starts to overlap with your text. To fix this you could either shrink the size of the column for the text or use media queries to shrink the size of the image at this screen width (1000px).
