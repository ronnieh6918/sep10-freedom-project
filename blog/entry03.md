# Future ideas for my topic (Security and Investigations):
# Engineering Design Process:
I am on step 3: brainstorming possible solutions of the Engineering Design Process. For step 3, we're brainstorming ideas about our future topics. Resolving issues and making resolution by designing possible technologies that could advocate for a better change in the mere future. Although, these technologies are not available yet, as our technology advances we have more access to new technology that support human's quality of life. Ideas are infinite, anything is possible with imagination!
# Skills:

A skill I learned is **creativity**, making this blog requried a lot of creativity! Especially because determining a desire for future prototype on a field isn't really easy, and since there have been exisiting technologies that have been created already, this makes it more difficult for us to pick and make up a technology that haven't been made yet. Therefore, this blog was more towards the creativity sign, where my ideas gather together to design a prototype that can be beneficial to my current topic.
