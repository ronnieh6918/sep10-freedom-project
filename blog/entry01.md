__Context__:
For this first entry, I'm going to do a project on security/investigations. The reason I picked this topic is because I seem to really be dedicated to try and protect people around me, regardless if it's just a minor issue, I'd like to be able to encourage and help contribute to a more healthy surrounding environment for not just myself. I want to try to make an effort for society to understand the significant importance of security/investigation and to do so, I need to first be intelluctually prepared. Welcome to my first journey!

__The Engineering Process__:
I am currently in the first phase of the engineering process, "Indentifying the problem", the big problems that seem to really overwhelm me right now is attempting to get technological innovations that contribute to security and investigation in my sources. Although, it may seem very clueless on what technologies fall under "security and investigations", the likelyhood of finding a source about my topic is fairly difficult. Therefore, I must try identifying a possible solution.

__Skill__: 
My current skill that I've gained from making this blog is doing research by googling on different type of websites to try and help me gain factualized ideas.

__Professionalism__:
