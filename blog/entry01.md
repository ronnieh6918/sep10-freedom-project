# Entry 1
##### 10/7/2024
### __Context__:
For this first entry, I'm going to do a project on security/investigations. The reason I picked this topic is because I seem to really be dedicated to try and protect people around me, regardless if it's just a minor issue, I'd like to be able to encourage and help contribute to a more healthy surrounding environment for not just myself. I want to try to make an effort for society to understand the significant importance of security/investigation and to do so, I need to first be intelluctually prepared and educated on this topic. Welcome to my first journey!

### __The Engineering Process__:
I am currently in the first phase of the engineering process, "Indentifying the problem", where I have to discuss the current problems I have in creating the website for my topic. As of right now, my biggest concern goes to really just planning and trying to design it with a lot of effort and creativity put into. Thus, I would need to check out other websites made from my peers, so that I can learn from and get an idea of how I should start setting up my own future design!!

### __Skill__: 
My current skill that I've gained from making this blog is doing research by googling on different websites specifically focusing on this topic to share and inform all my audiences on getting the general gist of security and investigations, so feel free to check out the sources above. Also as I was creating this first ever blog, I went over some of the blog overview examples and checked out some of my school peer's blogs as an example to help me create this one!
