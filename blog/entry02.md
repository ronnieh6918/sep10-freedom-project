### Context:
Hello there, welcome to my second blog on my topic about security and investigations! Previously, I've talked about why I chose the topic, what was the topic is about, and the impact of security and investigation in modern society. Now, in this next blog entry, I plan to go over the following; what kind of gadgets is involved in security and investigation? How does it help bring more beneficial in helping private investigators with their case? So, there are many types gadgets for private investigators in various situations. According to [**some of the gadgets used by private investigators**](https://www.investigatesc.com/the-5-coolest-gadgets-and-gear-for-private-investigators/), the website talks about some of the significance in gadgets used in the field of security and investigators such as GPS Tracking that tracks activity allowing distance monitoring, and other gadgets like Device Cloning which allows investigators to copy a device in which private investigators can investigate activity through extracting data and information. Common gears like surveillance cameras help capture important footages that is beneficial for their investigations. This is important because with these tools and the knowledge that private investigators have using  google searches play a huge role for investigators to use their tools effectively even in the digital world, private investigators can reverse search important images leading to their suspects giving them sense of their background checks and other necessary documentaries. In addition, we learn that private investigators need to be skilled in using their gadgets and tools to help them investigate effectively. Based on [Things you didn't know about private investigators](https://www.pce.uw.edu/news-features/articles/things-you-didn-t-know-about-private-investigators
), to become an private investigator, you are also required to know the law even though they don't represent as lawyers. However, the website connects back to how private investigators are taught to use database to find background information to investigate certain person's background. Not all private investigators use just technology but surely it could be beneficial. For instance, some private investigators might be hired as undercover spy to investigate on suspects which require taking photos and videos of the individual's criminal activites to report on their findings.

### The Engineering Process:
I am on step 2 of the engineering design process...

### Skills: 
The skills I've learned from doing research on my topic is being **resourceful by using multiple websites** instead of using just 1. Having more information on a topic is beneficial since using one website to gather information just increases the risk of the information provided later on inside my blog become too generic, whereas researching on multiple websites allows other ideas to come together and build up establishing connections and more understanding on the field of my topic.  

Another skill I've learn from making this blog is using **time effectively**. For instance, when my teacher provided us with time in class to research about the gadgets in my topic, I used the time proficiently to do research, so that I wouldn't fall back behind in class when I write my second blog entry. This is really benefical due to the collecting of ideas from the sources I researched beforehand, boosting my knowledge on my topic and ease my work significantly since I already have all the materials I need to start writing this blog entry.
