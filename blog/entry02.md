### Skills: 
The skills I've learned from doing research on my topic is being **resourceful by using multiple websites** instead of using just 1.

Another skill I've learn from making this blog is using **time effectively**. For instance, when my teacher provided us with time in class to research about the gadgets in my topic, I used the time proficiently to do research, so that I wouldn't fall back behind in class when I write my second blog entry. This is really benefical due to the collecting of ideas from the sources I researched beforehand, boosting my knowledge on my topic and ease my work significantly since I already have all the materials I need to start writing this blog entry.
