Hello, welcome to my 4th Blog Entry. For this blog entry, I was well prepared with a tool to create my freedom project webdesign by exploring what the tool has to offer. I picked A-frame which in primarily uses HTML as a coding language. Aframe offers a lot, especially at creating 3D figures and striving towards creating more complex structures with HTML. Aframe is offers support to many wide range of devices even on consoles when immensed into VR experiences.
