# Context:
Hello, welcome to my 4th Blog Entry. For this blog entry, I was well prepared with a tool to create my freedom project webdesign by exploring different coding tools. I picked A-frame which in primarily uses mostly HTML as a coding language. Even with HTML, Aframe offers a lot, especially at creating 3D figures and striving towards creating more complex structures with HTML. Aframe offers support to many wide range of devices even on consoles when immensed into VR experiences from HTML codes. Aframe is a platform where it's open spaced to everybody who is interested in using Aframe and making availability to what it has to offer for its users.

When I explore Aframe, I was able to discover the starter code when navigating to DOCS, I tinkered with the starter code and ...

# Skills:
The skills I've required from tinkering with my freedom project tool is ...
* **Learning to ticker my tool effectively** - When I tinkered with Aframe, the figures were 3D and I was able to virtually move around just by using HTML codes. I realized that using Aframe, I could code my webdesign into something like this.
* **Putting more into my imagination** - In reality, most webdesign don't have much animations, but just texts. I want to make my webdesign into something unique, where I could make my webdesign viewed by audience in a VR styled experience.  

# Next Steps:
After exploring Aframe, I want to stick with the tool. I want to be able to do more coding with Aframe to get a better understanding of what Aframe is really capable of, and how it can improve my webdesign significantly if I tickered the tool more. Of course, I will still keep my backup tool in case, but I have no plans to change my current tool.
