# Context:
Hello, welcome to my 4th Blog Entry. For this blog entry, I was well prepared with a tool to create my freedom project webdesign by exploring different coding tools. I picked A-frame which in primarily uses mostly HTML as a coding language. Even with HTML, Aframe offers a lot, especially at creating 3D figures and striving towards creating more complex structures with HTML. Aframe offers support to many wide range of devices even on consoles when immensed into VR experiences from HTML codes. Aframe is a platform where it's open spaced to everybody who is interested in using Aframe and making availability to what it has to offer for its users.
