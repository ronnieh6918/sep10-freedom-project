# Context:
Hello, welcome to my 4th Blog Entry. For this blog entry, I was well prepared with a tool to create my freedom project webdesign by exploring different coding tools. I picked A-frame which in primarily uses mostly HTML as a coding language. Even with HTML, Aframe offers a lot, especially at creating 3D figures and striving towards creating more complex structures with HTML. Aframe offers support to many wide range of devices even on consoles when immensed into VR experiences from HTML codes. Aframe is a platform where it's open spaced to everybody who is interested in using Aframe and making availability to what it has to offer for its users.

# Tinkering with A-Frame
When I explore Aframe, I was able to discover the starter code when navigating to DOCS, I tinkered with the starter code. The code allowed me to position the shape by adjusting the horizontal, vertical, and the size. While also offering each figure with a different color. I noticed that the starter code provided a unique background, and I was able to move around to visually see the shapes. The starter code uses a lot of concepts from AVD which involves concepts of coloring, positioning, geometry, animations, etc... The code seems to be a combination of these concept, meaning I could incooperate these concept when coding with Aframe. First, I adjusted the color of the box, sphere, and cylinder to purple, blue, green respectfully. Then, I adjusted the positioning of the

      <a-sphere position="0 1.25 -5" radius="1.25" color="#EF2D5E"></a-sphere>
      <a-cylinder position="1 0.75 -3" radius="0.5" height="1.5" color="#FFC65D"></a-cylinder>
      <a-plane position="0 0 -4" rotation="-90 0 0" width="4" height="4" color="#7BC8A4"></a-plane>
      <a-sky color="#ECECEC"></a-sky>

### Why Aframe?
1) I used the introduction page of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.7.0/introduction/) to gather context revolving around what Aframe was about. A web framework to build unique VR experiences with HTML. Seeing this and tinkering with the code, I was impressed at how realistic it was, I could move around freely to visually see 3D figures. The background also wasn't just a specific color but resembles an actually sky almost like in videogames. 
2) To learn more about Aframe, I had to use youtube videos,

# Skills:
The skills I've required from tinkering with my freedom project tool is ...
* **Learning to ticker my tool effectively** - When I tinkered with Aframe, the figures were 3D and I was able to virtually move around just by using HTML codes. I realized that using Aframe, I could code my webdesign into something like this.
* **Putting more into my imagination** - In reality, most webdesign don't have much 3D figures, but just texts. I could learn to use properties of different shapes as 3D figures to create something unique especially to creating for the future tools I planned onto my freedom project.   

# Next Steps:
After exploring Aframe, I want to stick with the tool. I want to be able to do more coding with Aframe to get a better understanding of what Aframe is really capable of, and how it can improve my webdesign significantly if I tickered the tool more. Of course, I will still keep my backup tool in case, but I have no plans to change my current tool.
