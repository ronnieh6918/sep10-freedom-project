# Context

# EDP
Currently, I am on step 5 of the Engineering Design Process, I created a prototype which is my freedom project. I move onto step 6 which is recieving feed backs from my peers on how I could make my website much better and honestly more responsive. The problem I had with my website was the responsiveness and making all my cards have the same length and width, hence none of the cards look uneven. From the feed backs of my peers, I was able to address these issues prior to the day of my presentation. 

# Skills
* **Organization** = I organized most of my stuff using a wireframe before making my project. The main illustration of how my website would look like in its MVP before making it into a website above MVP. My wireframe both have a visual representation of all my contents, but also for the responsiveness on devices such as mobile and computers.

# Takeaways

I plan on taking the time to add onto my project and make it more better. I also want to try and recieve more feed back of my prototype to make sure the prototype is ready to be presented to others.
