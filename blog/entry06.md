# Context

Welcome to Blog 6, with all the content that I learned about my freedom project topic and putting all those into my website dedicated to **"Security and Investigation"**, I was able to make this website through adding HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and tinkering with A-Frame. In my website, I used the [Bootstrap's official website](https://getbootstrap.com/) to add bootstrap components such as cards, navbar, and carousel. In my website, I also tinkered using [A-Frame's official website](https://aframe.io/) to create new future technologies that benefit the field connecting to my freedom project topic and adding in how these technologies would function through adding in my own ideas. 

When making this website, I've faced many challenges. Here is one of the challenges I've face when trying to make my website more responsive. My peers suggested on using media queries since on a large screen size, the text and images overlap in my website. For example, on a large device, the image takes up more space than the text. Hence, I had used the grid system that made it so both the image and text took up 1/2 of the screen on large and extra large devices (using ``div class="col-lg-6"`` for both image and text). 

This is what it looked when both text and image took up 1/2 of the viewport respectively on a **large device**:

While, this is what it looked when both text and image took up 1/2 of the viewport respectively on a **extra large device**:

So the solution? Since I didn't know how to use media queries, I sticked with using the grid system that bootstrap offers. I knew that on a large screen, it is way smaller than on extra large. So, even though I tried ``div class="col-lg-6`` which made my text and image overlap on a large device, it worked fairly well on an extra large device. Hence, I made adjustments such as that on large device, the image will take up 2/3 of the viewport using ``div class="col-lg-8`` and then using ``div class="col-lg-4"`` so that the text in a large device will take up the rest of the 1/3. As for an extra large device, both text and image remains taking up 1/2 respectively, therefore I created a separate class for extra large device which is ``div class="col-xl-6"``.



# EDP

Currently, I am on step 5 of the Engineering Design Process, I created a prototype which is my freedom project. I move onto step 6 which is recieving feed backs from my peers on how I could make my website much better and honestly more responsive. The problem I had with my website was the responsiveness and making all my cards have the same length and width, hence none of the cards look uneven. From the feed backs of my peers, I was able to address these issues prior to the day of my presentation. 

# Skills

* **Organization** = I organized most of my stuff using a wireframe before making my project. The main illustration of how my website would look like in its MVP before making it into a website above MVP. My wireframe both have a visual representation of all my contents, but also for the responsiveness on devices such as mobile and computers. 
* **Time management** = My time when making this website took really long and most of my time, I was also on a camping trip which meant I missed most of the days when we were supposed to be working on the project in class and at home. When I got back from the camping trip, I missed so much of the days and had an upcoming AP test that I had to study, so that meant that I priotized my days studying before actually starting to finish and wrapping up the website after the test was over. 

# Takeaways

I plan on taking the time to add onto my project and make it more better. I also want to try and recieve more feed back of my prototype to make sure the prototype is ready to be presented to others.
