Hello, welcome to Blog Entry 7, where I'll be discussing how I had to present my freedom project to several students in our school that visited the SEP expo, while also having to create an elevator pitch that gave a short and brief presentation of how we were going to present our projects in front of actual judges. Although, the elevator pitch was supposed to be short and explain most of the details that we have on the website, much of the presentation during the expo tests on presentation skills, the creativity of our project, eye contact, and other significant key components that is being scored on. During the expo, the challenges that I mostly had was public speaking skills, even though we made an elevator pitch, I was still stressed at presenting these information with the mindset of my presentation being too short or even too long. Hence, I struggled on managing my time effectively especially when the judges came to my table to hear about my presentation, I didn't know if the information I presented would be too brief and so I might have added a few challenges to accomodate the duration of the elevator pitch, which was probably why I thought personally that my presentation was too long. During my presentation, I was able to present much of the information based on my elevator pitch, I still felt like the one minute put me on a lot of pressure. For example, I wanted to show the judges about a lot of things on my website, but since we had to condense the information under a certain given time, it was very difficult to figure out if I should discuss more information beyond the planning of my elevator pitch. Also, since public speaking is something that makes me nervous when answering to the judges, I definitely stuttered a lot compared to the practice presentation in front of my class before the actual expo began. I added challenges from my [presentation slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XleHHcOvsN7VwU0hxrm_7MsHXu9Ql5lckj_aXe_ekVU/edit?usp=sharing), but in the end that only made my presentation longer. In conclusion, I learned that presentations are something that I want to dedicate more time in practicing. Next time, I also want to make sure I condense my information rather than worrying about the length of my presentation. Since, the elevator pitch lasted only a minute, I want to make sure I'm able to stick with what I wrote on the plan rather than adding more information which probably made my presentation really long making it worse than better.
